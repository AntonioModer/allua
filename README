Allua readme

This is a development release of Allua. This is a work in progress that follows
the development of Allegro 5. So it only works with a certain WIP release of Allegro 4.9.x.



Building Allua:

Requirements:
Allegro 4.9.14 [http://sourceforge.net/projects/alleg/files/allegro-unstable/4.9.14/]
Lua [www.lua.org]
premake4 [http://industriousone.com/premake] to build the project.
NaturalDocs [www.naturaldocs.org] (Only if you want to build reference manual)
luaunit [luaforge.net] (only for unit tests) 

Build howto:
First open a terminal and get to the Allua folder.
Enter premake4 gmake (or what environment you're building for)
Enter make to build
Enter premake4 install to install Allua.



Using Allua:
You can run a Lua script that uses Allua simply by running 'lua myscript.lua'
if you have installed Allua properly.
See naturoids.lua in the test folder for how to use Allua in scripts.

TODO: Work out a guide for using Allua with a C/C++ project.



Documentation:
Allua only provides a simple reference manual, 
for full explanation of all the functions you should read Allegro's documentation.

A prebuilt version of the documentation is available for download here
http://github.com/trezker/allua/downloads

You may also get NaturalDocs and built the documentation yourself, 
but that's really only for people who wish to help develop Allua.
